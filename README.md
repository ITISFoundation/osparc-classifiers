# osparc-classifiers

A curated list of classifiers defined and used by the osparc-community


### Concept

- A classifier is a label with a hierarchical format (e.g. ``programming-language::python``) and its associated metadata (e.g. description, maintainer, ...) that is curated by the community
- Classifiers are used to annotate osparc entities (e.g. services, studies, data) in a particular subject area,
- The concept of a classifier here combines two already existing implementations: the python distribution metadata standard [PEP 301](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0301/#distutils-trove-classification) for the hierarchical labels and the curation workflow of [Github Explore](https://github.com/github/explore#github-explore).


### Examples

- python packages are annotated using [these classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/)
- Github explore [topics](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/topics)
